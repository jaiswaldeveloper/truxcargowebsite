                  COD or cash on delivery option is available at popular courier
                  companies. With this option, sellers can ship their products
                  to their customers and collect payments from them via the cash
                  on delivery mode. The payments that are collected by the
                  courier companies from the customers are then transferred to
                  the seller, through a process called remittance. The amount is
                  first collected by the delivery agent and deposited in the
                  head office against the AWB/LR number of the shipment.
