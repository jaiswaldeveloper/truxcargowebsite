                  <h3>Benefits of having Multiple Pick Up Locations</h3>
                  <h4>Faster Delivery Time</h4>
                  <p>
                    Get your products delivered faster at your customers’
                    doorstep by selecting the pickup location nearest to your
                    buyer’s address. It helps in faster delivery by eliminating
                    the extra transit time.

                  <h4>Lower Shipping Cost</h4>
                  <p>
                    By selecting the nearest pickup address to the delivery
                    location, you also reduce the overall shipping cost. It’s
                    beneficial as the seller ships from a pick-up location that
                    is nearest to the customer’s address.
