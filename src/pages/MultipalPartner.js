                  <h3>Benefits of multiple courier partners</h3>
                  <h4>Increased reach</h4>
                  <p>
                    If you have multiple courier partners, you can expand your
                    business to different states. You can make deliveries to a
                    different states which will, in turn, help your business to
                    grow wide with each day. Thus, you do not have to turn down
                    customers that are far from your business or have a distant
                    pin code. If you have multiple courier services, then you
                    can make delivery possible at any place within a limited
                    period. If you have local partners, then you increase the
                    overall reach of your business by having potential customers
                    at every corner of the country. Besides, this expanded reach
                    can create an overall strong base of your valued customers.

                  <h4>Best prices</h4>
                  <p>
                    A different carrier offers different prices for their
                    services. This is how the competitive market works. Some
                    carrier keeps a cheaper price point while some other carrier
                    keeps a higher price point when it comes to shipping
                    mid-sized packages. Some carriers straight-up refuse to
                    carry oversized packages, whereas some carriers specialize
                    in the same.

                  <h4>The convenience of delivery services during festivals</h4>
                  <p>
                    During the festivals, the struggle and rush for deliveries
                    are real. Whether it is a small start-up company or a big
                    e-commerce giant, every company faces trouble in delivering
                    a huge number of packages. Customers nowadays tend to shop
                    online, so they find the festive seasons the perfect
                    opportunity to buy online which is much more convenient than
                    the retail stores. People now tend to avoid the huge crowds
                    in clothing stores and prefer shopping online. Thus, the
                    festive seasons get the busiest with thousands of delivery
                    requests. At this point, companies can’t keep up with the
                    delivery deadlines. If you have multiple courier partners,
                    then this can be well handled and your customers stay
                    satisfied with your company. Many courier services will
                    deliver your items at your customers convenience.

                    It is similar to having an extra pair of glasses, so that if
                    you lose or damage the current glasses. Multiple courier
                    partners will ensure you that you never have to give any
                    kind of excuses to your customers. They will ensure that you
                    never disappoint your customers when it comes to deliveries.
                    There are thousands of possible difficulties that can arise
                    in a day to day business, but if you have multiple courier
                    service providers you can stay assured that your products
                    and administrations will be delivered to your customers even
                    if one of the partners is unavailable.
